h1. jquery.formidable

Formidable takes care of common tasks associated with setting up a submit once only form including but not limited to disabling submission, disabling inputs, toggling spinners, and defualt field value behavior. Formidable is intended to be a lightweight, no bells-and-whistles helper plugin on top of jQuery, and jquery.validate.

It is based on what I believe to be a simple and sensible pattern for form markup.

h2. Using this plugin

Coming soon!

h2. TODOS
* Make more configurable
* Accept a set of AJAX options (no defaults - I believe in using #ajax) and take care of this with appropriate form disabling / enabling
* Add a little integration with jquery.validate
* Intefere with the jQuery object less
* Add example
* Add minified version
* Organize code
